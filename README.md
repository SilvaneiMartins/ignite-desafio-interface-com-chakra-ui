<h1 align="center">
  Interface with Chakra UI
</h1>

### 🚧About the Challenge... 🚧

In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far in ReactJS

This will be an application where you have two main goals. The first is to develop the entire interface using Chakra UI as a base. The other is that you should work on the responsiveness of the application (and this is where your creativity can shine even more).

You will start a Next.js application from scratch on your own machine and implement the interface as per Figma's layout.

Next, we will see in more detail what and how it needs to be done..🚀
